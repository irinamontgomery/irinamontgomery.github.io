            <p>My name is Irina Montgomery. Started learning to code beginning of October 2018. I have improved my skills after taking University of Minnesota Coding Bootcamp. This is definitely a career change for me as I use to be a dispatcher. </p>
            <p>I am always learning new things and getting better as I go. Coding is about doing it repeatedly, failing, fixing and learning how to do things better. But you will never get better if you don’t work on the areas you struggle in. This is how you will learn and grow. I’m excited for this journey and new career in my life as I continue to get better. </p>
